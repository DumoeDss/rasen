## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Archive Validation

The archive command SHALL validate changes before applying them to ensure data integrity. When validation blocks the archive in human (non-`--json`) mode, the command SHALL set a non-zero process exit code so scripts and CI can distinguish a blocked archive from a successful one, matching the existing `--json`-mode behavior.

#### Scenario: Pre-archive validation

- **WHEN** executing `rasen archive change-name`
- **THEN** validate the change structure first
- **AND** only proceed if validation passes
- **AND** show validation errors if it fails

#### Scenario: Force archive without validation

- **WHEN** executing `rasen archive change-name --no-validate`
- **THEN** skip validation (unsafe mode)
- **AND** show warning about skipping validation

#### Scenario: Blocked archive sets a non-zero exit code in human mode

- **WHEN** a non-`--json` archive is blocked at any human-mode abort point — delta-spec validation failure, spec-rebuild failure, or rebuilt-spec validation failure — and nothing is archived
- **THEN** the command sets `process.exitCode = 1` before returning
- **AND** the failure is still printed to the console
- **AND** a legitimate user cancellation (declining a confirmation prompt, selecting no change) leaves the exit code at 0

### Requirement: Spec Update Process

Before moving the change to archive, the command SHALL apply delta changes to main specs to reflect the deployed reality.

#### Scenario: Applying delta changes

- **WHEN** archiving a change with delta-based specs
- **THEN** parse and apply delta changes as defined in openspec-conventions
- **AND** validate all operations before applying

#### Scenario: Validating delta changes

- **WHEN** processing delta changes
- **THEN** perform validations as specified in openspec-conventions
- **AND** if validation fails, show specific errors and abort

#### Scenario: Conflict detection

- **WHEN** applying deltas would create duplicate requirement headers
- **THEN** abort with error message showing the conflict
- **AND** suggest manual resolution

#### Scenario: Zero-requirements spec deletion

- **WHEN** applying a change's deltas leaves an existing spec with zero requirements (every requirement REMOVED, none remaining)
- **THEN** the command SHALL delete that spec's directory from the main specs instead of writing an empty spec
- **AND** SHALL log a clear message naming the deleted capability
- **AND** SHALL treat this as a supported outcome, not a validation failure (no abort)
- **AND** `rasen validate --strict` SHALL pass afterward because the spec no longer exists rather than being left empty
- **AND** SHALL NOT delete a spec that still has any surviving requirement, nor a spec that did not already exist before this change

#### Scenario: Stale MODIFIED block dropping current scenarios is rejected

- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement block in a change delta omits one or more scenarios that the current main spec still contains for that requirement (scenario drift, e.g. two changes each MODIFY the same requirement and the second was authored before the first archived)
- **THEN** the command SHALL abort the spec rebuild with an error naming the requirement and the missing scenario(s), instructing the author to refresh the change spec before archiving
- **AND** SHALL NOT overwrite the main spec (no scenarios are silently dropped)
- **AND** the change SHALL remain unarchived
