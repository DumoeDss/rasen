## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Pipeline CLI Surface

The system SHALL provide a `rasen pipeline` command group with `list`, `show <name>`, `agents <name>`, `classify "<task>"`, and `resume <change>` subcommands, each supporting `--json`. Every subcommand SHALL resolve its Rasen root through the shared root-selection layer used by `rasen validate` — the same nearest-root walk, implicit-root fallback, and `--store <id>` selector — so a given directory or store resolves to the identical root across `pipeline` and `validate`. No pipeline subcommand SHALL resolve its root from the current working directory alone. `resume` SHALL locate run-state per the `change-work-dir` capability: the change's external work directory is checked first, falling back to the change directory, and the JSON output SHALL report the directory the run-state (or portfolio state) was actually read from (`runStateDir`) so a resuming orchestrator writes updates where it read them. Locating run-state SHALL NOT write to the repository or the registry.

#### Scenario: List and show

- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline list --json` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL print the resolved pipelines with name, description, and source
- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline show <name> --json` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL print the pipeline's full stage DAG including all stage metadata

#### Scenario: Classify

- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline classify "<task description>" --json` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return a suggested pipeline name plus the indicators that drove the suggestion
- **AND** it SHALL report the suggestion's basis: `keyword` when indicators matched, `default` when the suggestion is the fallback default with no matched indicators
- **AND** the suggestion SHALL be overridable by the caller

#### Scenario: Resume

- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline resume <change> --json` runs
- **THEN** it SHALL return the next incomplete stage and the remaining stages, derived from the change's artifacts and run-state
- **AND** the run-state SHALL be read from the change's work directory when present there, falling back to the change directory in the resolved root — never from the current working directory
- **AND** when run-state is found, the JSON SHALL include `runStateDir` naming the directory it was read from

#### Scenario: Resume reads legacy run-state

- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline resume <change> --json` runs for a change whose `auto-run.json` predates the work directory and lives in the change directory
- **THEN** it SHALL read that run-state (`hasRunState: true`) and report the change directory as `runStateDir`

#### Scenario: Root resolution matches validate

- **WHEN** `rasen pipeline list --json` and `rasen validate --pipelines --json` are run from the same subdirectory of a project, or with the same `--store <id>`
- **THEN** both SHALL resolve to the same Rasen root and report the same set of pipelines

#### Scenario: Store selection

- **WHEN** any `pipeline` subcommand is run with `--store <id>` naming a registered store
- **THEN** it SHALL operate on that store's root
- **AND** `pipeline resume <change> --store <id>` SHALL read run-state from that change's work directory (falling back to the store's change directory) and report `hasRunState: true` when that change has recorded run-state
